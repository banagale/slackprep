Yes, the output is correct, and the long duration is expected.

The `slackdump` tool is fetching over a year of messages (`2025-06-28` to `2026-07-07`) from *every* conversation your user has access to. This involves thousands of API calls to Slack, which are rate-limited, so the process can easily take several minutes or longer for large workspaces.

The line `. <C01G5NP8VSL> (103/-) [2m16s]` confirms that the program is actively working on a channel and making progress, not frozen.

Here is the fully updated `README.md` with the requested link and improved examples.

# slackprep

Turn Slack conversations into useful data for LLM contexts.

## âš¡ Quick Start â€” One-liner to grab & reassemble everything

This command pulls ALL accessible channels, DMs, and private groups for a date range, then immediately converts them to Markdown.

This tool avoids rate limiting, so it may take several minutes or longer depending on the amount of chats involved.

### Getting a Slack Token

You'll need a Slack OAuth token with sufficient permissions (`channels:history`, `groups:history`, `im:history`, `mpim:history`, `users:read`, etc.).

For a quick, one-off export, you can generate a temporary token:
1.  Go to **[https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)** 
2.  If you can generate a 12 hour app config api token, do that it will work. 
3.  Otherwise:
    a. Create a new app in your workspace.
    b. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions**. 
    c. Add the required scopes under **User Token Scopes**.
    d. Install the app to your workspace and copy the **User OAuth Token** (`xoxp-...`). 

### Running the command

```bash
# Export everything from last month, clean it up, and prep for an LLM
slackprep fetch-all \
  --start-date 2025-06-01 \
  --end-date   2025-07-07 \
  --cleanup \
  --prep
````

The script will securely prompt for your token if it's not set as an environment variable (`SLACK_API_TOKEN`).

**Result:**

```
data/input/slackdump_all_<timestamp>/         # Raw JSON from slackdump
data/output/slackdump_all_<timestamp>/reassembled_<â€¦>.md
```

Feed the resulting Markdown straight into your favourite summarizer or [FileKitty](https://github.com/banagale/FileKitty).

## ðŸŒ± Quick Start (existing export ZIP)

Already have a Slack export `.zip` file?

```bash
unzip slack-export.zip -d data/input/my_export
slackprep reassemble --input-dir data/input/my_export
```

-----

## ðŸŽ¯ Target a single channel / DM

To export just one conversation, use `fetch` with a channel or DM ID.

```bash
# Export one conversation only, then reassemble
slackprep fetch C08ABCXYZ --prep
```

-----

## ðŸ›  Advanced / Separate steps

### 1\. Use slackdump yourself

For fine-grained control over the export, you can run `slackdump` directly.

```bash
# Note: slackdump uses the SLACK_API_TOKEN environment variable
export SLACK_API_TOKEN="xoxp-your-token"

slackdump export \
  -time-from 2025-06-01 \
  -time-to   2025-07-07 \
  -o data/input/vacation_catchup_raw/
```

### 2\. Reassemble later

```bash
slackprep reassemble --input-dir data/input/vacation_catchup_raw/
```

```
```
